# A Udacity FSND project. (Item Catalog)

# Project Overview

I develop an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provides user registration and authentication system.
Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.

## What I Learned?

I learned how to develop a RESTful web application using the Python framework Flask along with implementing third-party OAuth authentication. and then I learned when to properly use the various HTTP methods available and how these methods relate to CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations.

### Skills used for this project

Python
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap
Flask
Jinja2
SQLAchemy
OAuth
Facebook / Google Login

## What you need to RUN?
1/ [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.htmlb.VirtualMachine)

2/ [VirtualMachine](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloadsc.Download)

3/ [Download	a	FSND	VirtualMachine ](https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm)

4/ [Python]( https://www.python.org)

## Database file

Download the [newsdata.sql](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dwwdrerml1nf0mf/newsdata.sql?dl=0)


## How you can RUN this project?

1- Install Vagrant and VirtualBox
2- Clone the fullstack-nanodegree-vm
3- Launch the Vagrant VM (vagrant up)
4- CD to Flask application locally in the vagrant/catalog directory (which will automatically be synced to /vagrant/catalog within the VM).
5- Run The application within the VM (python /vagrant/catalog/application.py)
6 Access and test The application by visiting http://localhost:8000 locally
